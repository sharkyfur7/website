So... the wobbegong... is not an actual shark, but a family of similar carpet sharks. Wobbegongs (what a goofy name lmao) live in shallow temperate and tropical waters. They live on the sea floor and have cool camo. It supposedly somewhat resembles a carpet??? I mean I guess kinda... That's why wobbegong sharks and their close relatives are named "carpet sharks".

They also have these kind of whiskers that help with the camoflauge and also act as sensory organs. They're an ambush predators (which works well for them thanks to all the camo) and are active at night.

Most wobbegongs have a conservation status of "least concern". Basically their population is doing good. Though there is one exception, that being the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_wobbegong">Indonesian Wobbegong</a> which is near threatened (suspected population decrease of 20–29% over the last 27 years <a target="_blank" href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/176486152/176486163">IUCN</a>).
