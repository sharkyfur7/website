**Fun fact:** this shark does not meow.

<blockquote class="warning-bq">
    <strong>Warning! This shark is vulnerable!</strong>
    <p>
        In 2020, the IUCN has classified the Blacktip Reef Shark as vulnerable. This is thanks to not only industrial and small-scale fishing and poor water quality but also thanks to climate change decreasing the quality of coral reefs (that's where they live, it's a reef shark, DUH!). The population is estimated to have reduced by 30–49% over the last 44 years. <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/39375/58303674" target="_blank">[source]</a>

## Overview

The blacktip reef shark is a pretty cool shark that is easily identifiable
by the black tips of it's fins. They're TINY compared to other sharks,
usually not longer than 1.6 meters. And their pups are adorable!

## Diet

Their diet consists mainly of small fish 🐟. Rarely they eat things like
squid, shrimp and smaller sharks. Sometimes they'll snack on a sea snake or
two! Company of others isn't a problem either, groups of blacktip reef
sharks have been seen herding fish towards shore for easier feeding.

## Habitat

They live around coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific and tolerate lower
salinity. Unlike other reef sharks they like being in shallow waters. So
sometimes they go to mangroves when the tide rises. During low tide they
mostly chill at coral reefs. Occasionally they like an area so much that
they'll stay there for several years.
