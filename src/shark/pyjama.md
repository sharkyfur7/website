The Pyjama shark (or the Striped Catshark) is... a species of... well... shark! It's name comes from it's dark stripes that run all the way from the tip of it's head down to the end of it's tail (it looks like it's wearing a pyjama). They live around reefs in shallow waters around South African shores. They're sometimes caught as bycatch and killed because they are thought to be pests for some reason.

Fun fact: these creatures curl up into a ball and try to cover their head with their tail when they feel threathened!

We actually see them in their sleeping outfit because they are mostly active at night, idk if they change to a normal outfit when they go out at night but probably not lol. They hunt things like small fish or squid and other invertebrates. But they grow to like, 1.1m at best, so they're not really dangrouns to humans. I mean they can certainly try to bite you but it won't be as bad as if a [lemon shark](/shark/lemon/) tried doing that haha.

This shark is often displayed at aquariums because it's small, not dangerous and adapts well to captivity. Also because they're super cute :3
