The nurse shark is a pretty calm and friendly species of shark. They are
timid bottom dwellers and have jaws filled with lots of tiny sharp teeth.
They can also pump water over their gills eliminating the need to move to be
able to breate. Attacks by this species are usually caused by careless
divers not respecting the animal.

The nurse shark's diet consists primarily of small fish üêü, crustaceans ü¶Ä
and occasionally even algae. They are nocturnal, searching for food on the
sea floor during night. They have the ability to create suction and suck
algae off of corals or sift through the sediments on the sea floor.

These little guys usually stay inshore. The pups stick to coral reefs or
seagrass flats whereas the older sharks tend to stay at deeper reefs leaving
their shelter to feed in shallower areas during night. Interestingly they
also have something typical of reef sharks: site fidelity, a tendency to
stick to a particular area. And it is also one of the few sharks that
exhibits mating site fidelity, returning to the same area to breed.
