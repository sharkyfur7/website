<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  I am <span data-tooltip="🐟 or 🦈 ???" id="name">Sharky</span>, the fish! I like sharks, computers and other stuff. I
  mainly program websites. <br />
</p>

<p>
  This got A LOT longer than I expected it to... well what can I say, when I can rant about things I'm interested in I
  can write forever xd.

<h2>How I started programming?</h2>
<p>
  Originally (like sometime through 2021 i think) I wanted to make games, but realized pretty fast that that is not that
  easy
  <span id="that-streak">(that streak: 3x 🔥)</span>. So I just occasionally made a script or program just because I was
  bored. I have a lot (10+) unfinished projects that are like two or three years old xd.
</p>

<h3>The indie web</h3>
<p>
  Then I found out about
  <a href="https://neocities.org">neocities</a> and the indie web as a whole (circa late 2023) and it made me realize
  that webdev doesn't have to be all the modern slop with javascript frameworks and whatever else. It made me realize
  that sites can just be much simpler (though bare HTML and CSS is a bitch to maintain at scale lol).
</p>
<p>
  My site isn't that simple (still not as complex as modern sites though haha) but that is thanks to constant updates
  since April 2025 (<a href="https://github.com/sharkyfur7/website/commits/main/">over 200 commits</a>! wow!). I've had
  other "personal site" projects, however I abandoned or gave up on them. This one seems like it could last a bit longer
  though...
</p>

<h3>Should you do all that too?</h3>
<p>
  If you're thinking about making a website, do it. Just put whatever you like on there (like I did with
  <a href="/shark">sharks</a>!) Lowkey, all you really need is a bunch of HTML and CSS files. Just experiment and get
  inspired by other sites, that's pretty much how I get ideas on what to add onto my site.
</p>

<h2>What else do I do?</h2>
<h3>Books!</h3>

<p>
  <img style="float: right; height: 150px; margin-left: 8px; margin-bottom: 4px" src="/assets/dragonslayer.jpg" />

  Well I read a little. I've read all 15 books from the series Wings of Fire (dragon stuff). Also I've read the
  Darkstalker book and plan on reading Dragonslayer @ some point lol (pictured on the right, here). I really love
  dragons, maybe as much as sharks... Other than that I've read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit by Tolkien and the
  Inheritance Cycle by Paolini. I loved reading all these books and I'm SUPER excited for the 16'th Wings of Fire book!
</p>

<h3>Some hardware too!</h3>
<p>
  Also I played around a bit with an Arduino and an ESP32. It's really cool to see whatever code you type on your
  computer actually do something in the real world because usually it's just some text on a display. This is why I love
  webdev, you get direct visual feedback when you work unlike with backend stuff.
</p>

<p>
  Woah, you're reading all of this? I don't believe you, you just skipped to the bottom didn't you? If you DID read all
  of that, I can't thank you enough for taking time out of your day to give some attention to my little corner of the
  web and me. I hope you enjoy your stay!
